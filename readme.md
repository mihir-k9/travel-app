# Travel App

### Introduction

Here's a small app I made to test out ML models from Hugging Face and deployment using streamlit. Follow instructions below after going to this [link](https://travel-app-mk.streamlit.app) or running the app locally.

### How To Use

1. Upload an image (example, a mountain).
2. The app will classify the image, then suggest a tourist spot where you could find such scenery (example Swiss Alps).
